<tr><td>IARL</td><td>Archival Location</td><td>Indicates where the subject of the file is archived.<br/><br/>
<b>U.S. National Archives Application:</b><p>This element is an approximate equivalent to the Originator element in the Broadcast Wave BEXT chunk which records the entity responsible for the 'archiving' (creation, maintenance, preservation) of this digital item. Of all the info list chunk elements, this is the most important for Federal Agencies because it is vital to document the archival responsibility for a content item.</p>
<p>Entity designations should be as specific as possible including a two-character county code to avoid the potential for conflict in the archiving entityâ€™s name. The archival entity should be identified at the most specific level within the institution.</p>
<b>U.S. National Archives Use:</b> Strongly recommended ('required') if using LIST-INFO chunk.<br/><br/>

Almost always one word all caps but there are some acronyms that are more than one word.
